# Garajak
A user would enter the application and select a garage from the list of participating garages following approval. A tow truck would then arrive at the user's previously entered location and pick up the car and take it to the garage.

## Getting Started

a team of four submitted this project in response to a project request from a university subject.
Flutter was chosen because of the university course.
